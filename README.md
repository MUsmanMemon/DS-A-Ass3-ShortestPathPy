# DS-A-Ass3-ShortestPathPy

This code was written as a solution to my Assignment 3 for my course CSCI203 Data Structure and Algorithms at UNiversity of Wollongong. We were given vertices and in the form of a maze and we had to find the shortest path from a given start and end point. I have shared a detailed description to the solution in the the mum_123_a3.pdf.
